## Overview of the analysis

In this module we learned to Extract, Transform and LOad the Data.
We extracted the existing data from multiple csv files.  We didn't use 
all the data there that we extracted but transformed what we did need
into new tables by using PGADMIN.  We then created tables and new csv
files to break down exactly what we were looking for, in this case we
were looking for how much more we needed to achieve our pledged goals.
